"""
Given a  32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.
Note:
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [âˆ’2^31,  2^31 âˆ’ 1]. 
For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

Example:

Input: 123
Output: 321
